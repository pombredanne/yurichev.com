_HEADER_HL1(`[SMT][Z3][Python] Organize your backups')

<p>
In the era of audio cassettes (1980s, 1990s), many music lovers recorded their own mix tapes with tracks/songs they like.
Each side of audio cassette was 30 or 45 minutes.
The problem was to make such an order of songs, so that a minimal irritating "silent" track at the end of each side would left.
</p>

<p>This is classic _HTML_LINK(`https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing_problem',`bin packing problem'): all bins (cassettes) are equally sized.</p>

<p>Now let's advance this problem further: bins can be different.
You may want to backup your files to all sorts of storages you have: DVD-RWs, USB-sticks, remote hosts, cloud storage accounts, etc.
This is a "Multiple Knapsack Problem" - you've got several knapsacks with different sizes.</p>

<p>This code is also a siplification of my previous post: only one "dimension" (file size) is used: _HTML_LINK(`https://yurichev.com/blog/VM_packing/',`Packing virtual machines into servers').</p>

<p>Now something practical. You may want to store each file twice. And no pair must reside on a single storage.
Not a problem, just make two arrays of variables:</p>

...

         s.add(And(file1_in_storage[i]>=0, file1_in_storage[i]&lt;t))
         s.add(And(file2_in_storage[i]>=0, file2_in_storage[i]&lt;t))
         # no pair can reside on one storage:
         s.add(file1_in_storage[i] != file2_in_storage[i])

...

             Sum([If(file1_in_storage[f]==i, files[f], 0) for f in range(files_n)])+
             Sum([If(file2_in_storage[f]==i, files[f], 0) for f in range(files_n)]))
